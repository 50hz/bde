/Component Overview
/------------------
 This section summarizes the components that are available in &#39;bsls&#39;.

/&#39;bsls_alignedbuffer&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a templated buffer type with a user-specified
 compile-time size and user-specified alignment.  Typically, such a type is
 used in situations where it is desirable to allocate a block of
 properly-aligned raw memory from somewhere other than the heap, e.g., on the
 stack or within an aggregate object, including within a union.  It is a
 convenient way to create a small heap from which one or more objects are
 allocated at run-time.

/&#39;bsls_alignment&#39;
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component computes (at compile-time) platform-dependent alignment
 information.  This component also provides a namespace for a suite of
 compile-time constants and pure procedures that yield platform-dependent
 alignment information for primitive and user-defined types, including the
 maximum alignment for any type and the smallest fundamental type requiring
 maximum alignment.  These functions, used in conjunction, are especially
 useful for creating pools and allocators that rely on efficient alignment.

/&#39;bsls_alignmentfromtype&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a meta-function that provides the alignment for the
 parameterized &#39;TYPE&#39;.

/&#39;bsls_alignmentimp&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a suite of template meta-functions that can be used to
 compute (at compile-time) various platform-dependent alignment information.

/&#39;bsls_alignmenttotype&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a meta-function that provides a primitive type with an
 alignment matching the parameterized &#39;ALLIGNMENT&#39;.

/&#39;bsls_alignmentutil&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a suite of template meta-functions that can be used to
 compute (at compile-time) various platform-dependent alignment information.

/&#39;bsls_annotation&#39;
/- - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a suite of preprocessor macros that define
 compiler-specific compile-time annotations.

/&#39;bsls_assert&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 This component provides a pair of &quot;assert-like&quot; macros to implement a
 compile-time-selectable and run-time-configurable &quot;defensive&quot; or &quot;safe&quot; mode.
 It also provides a suite of &quot;assert-failure handler&quot; methods suitable for
 runtime loading into the macros, via also provided methods.  Users may supply
 their own handler methods matching the proper signature.  To allow the user
 more flexibility in changing handlers during program execution, this component
 also provides a scoped guard that allows safe, temporary changing of the
 failure handler in a limited scope.

/&#39;bsls_asserttest&#39;
/- - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a facility to test that &#39;BSLS_ASSERT_*&#39; macros are
 used as intended, in the appropriate build modes, and have the expected
 effects.

/&#39;bsls_asserttestexception&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component implements an exception class, &#39;bsls::AssertTestException&#39;,
 that provides a mechanism to convey context information from a failing
 assertion to a test handler.

/&#39;bsls_atomic&#39;
/- - - - - - -
 This component provides classes with atomic operations for &#39;int&#39;, &#39;Int64&#39;, and
 pointer types.

/&#39;bsls_atomicoperations&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 This utility provides a set of platform-independent atomic operations for
 fundamental data types, such as 32-bit and 64-bit integer and pointer.

/&#39;bsls_blockgrowth&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - -
 This component enumerates the supported block growth strategies.

/&#39;bsls_bsltestutil&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides the standard printing macros used in BDE-style test
 drivers.

/&#39;bsls_buildtarget&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - -
 This component defines types and runtime constants for identifying the build
 target information (usually specified to the compiler via a set of
 &#39;BDE_BUILD_*&#39; macros).  This is mostly useful for retrieving such information
 from a linkable or executable binary.

/&#39;bsls_byteorder&#39;
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a set host-to-network and network-to-host byte-order
 manipulation macros.

/&#39;bsls_compilerfeatures&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a suite of preprocessor macros to identify
 compiler-specific support of language features that may not be available on
 all compilers in use across an organization.

/&#39;bsls_exceptionutil&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides macros to replace &#39;try&#39;, &#39;throw&#39; and &#39;catch&#39;.  These
 macros expand to normal exception constructs when exceptions are enabled and
 to reasonable alternatives (usually no-ops) when exceptions are disabled,
 allowing code that uses &#39;try&#39;, &#39;throw&#39; and &#39;catch&#39; constructs to compile even
 if exceptions are disabled using a compiler switch.

/&#39;bsls_ident&#39;
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides macros for inserting SCM (Source Control Management)
 Ids into source files.

/&#39;bsls_int64&#39;
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides platform-independent type names for both signed and
 unsigned 64-bit integers.  For healthy platforms, the component simply
 provides a BDE-standard &#39;typedef&#39; for the non-standard native type name.  All
 platforms currently supported are healthy regarding 64-bit integers.

/&#39;bsls_macroincrement&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a macro, &#39;BSLS_MACROINCREMENT(NUMBER)&#39;, that produces
 the preprocessor number equal to the number succeeding the supplied argument.

/&#39;bsls_nativestd&#39;
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component defines a namespace alias, &#39;native_std&#39;, that serves as an
 alias for the &#39;std&#39; namespace.

/&#39;bsls_nullptr&#39;
/ - - - - - - -
 This component provides a limited emulation of the C++11 type,
 &#39;std::nullptr_t&#39;, which can be used as a function parameter type to create an
 overload set where null pointer literals are handled specially.

/&#39;bsls_objectbuffer&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a templated buffer type, &#39;bsls_ObjectBuffer&#39;, which is
 compile-time sized and aligned to hold a specified object type.  Defining a
 &#39;bsls_ObjectBuffer&lt;T&gt;&#39; object does not cause the constructor for &#39;T&#39; to be
 called.  Similarly, destroying the object buffer does not call the destructor
 for &#39;T&#39;.  Typically, a &#39;bsls_ObjectBuffer&#39; is used in situations where
 efficient (e.g., stack-based) storage is required but where straightforward
 initialization or destruction of an object is not possible.  It can also be
 used to create a &#39;union&#39; containing non-POD element types.

/&#39;bsls_performancehint&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides performance hints for the compiler or hardware.

/&#39;bsls_platform&#39;
/- - - - - - - -
 This component defines preprocessor macros that identify and describe
 platform-specific attributes (at compile time).  These attributes consist of
 the types and versions of operating system, processor(s), and compiler that
 comprise the platform.

/&#39;bsls_platformutil&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a namespace for a collection of &#39;typedef&#39;s and pure
 procedures that would otherwise have platform-dependent interfaces.  For
 example, it defines the preferred fundamental types denoting signed and
 unsigned 64-bit integers, the preferred integral type denoting a number of
 elements in allocators and containers, provides the capability of determining
 whether a machine is big or little endian across all supported platforms, and
 defines a set of macros replacing the standard &#39;htonl&#39;, &#39;htons&#39;, &#39;ntohl&#39;, and
 &#39;ntohs&#39; which do not require including any system header.

/&#39;bsls_protocoltest&#39;
/- - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides classes and macros for testing abstract protocols.

/&#39;bsls_stopwatch&#39;
/ - - - - - - - -
 This component implements a real-time (system clock) interval timer.  A
 &#39;bsls_Stopwatch&#39; object can accumulate and return only one interval at a time,
 but may be started and stopped repeatedly without being reset, so the elapsed
 time &quot;interval&quot; accumulated by a single object may be from multiple,
 discontinuous segments of time.  The non-negative total accumulated time (in
 seconds) is available as a &#39;double&#39; value.

/&#39;bsls_timeutil&#39;
/- - - - - - - -
 This component provides a set of platform-neutral pure procedures to access
 real-time system clock functionality.  High-resolution time functions intended
 for interval-timing return an interval in nanoseconds (1 nsec = 1E-9 sec) as a
 64-bit integer.

/&#39;bsls_types&#39;
/ - - - - - -
 This component provides a namespace for a set of &#39;typedef&#39;s that provide a
 stable, portable interface to platform-dependent types.

/&#39;bsls_unspecifiedbool&#39;
/ - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component provides a class template that can be used to manufacture an
 &quot;unspecified boolean type&quot; that is distinct for each class that instantiates
 it.  *Not* for use outside the &#39;bsl&#39; package.

/&#39;bsls_util&#39;
/- - - - - -
 This component provides pure functions that supply essential low-level support
 for implementing portable generic facilities such as might be found the the
 C++ standard library.
