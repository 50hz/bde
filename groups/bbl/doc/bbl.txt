@PURPOSE: Provide a comprehensive foundation for component-based development.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Business Library (bbl)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bbl' ("Basic Business Library") package group contains
 various packages that provide platform-specific classes, meta-functions,
 defensive programming mechanisms, a framework for business tasks.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bbl' package group currently has 2 packages having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the packages.
 The order of packages within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

   2. bbldcu

   1. bblscm

/Package Synopsis
/----------------
: 'bbldcu':
:      Provide simple day-count implementations.
:
: 'bblscm':
:      Provide versioning information for BDE library components.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 The following provides a brief overview of the packages within the 'bbl'
 package group, arranged in alphabetical order.  Note that several packages,
 especially at lower levels in the physical hierarchy, are primarily intended
 for use by other packages within 'bbl'.  The descriptions here are still very
 brief; see the respective Package Level documents for more details and usage
 examples.

/'bbldcu'
/ - - - -
 {'bbldcu'} provides simple day-count implementations; for conventions only
 requiring the start and end dates to compute 'daysDiff' and 'yearsDiff'.

/'bblscm'
/ - - - -
 {'bblscm'} is a special source control management package containing only two
 components, 'bblscm_version' and 'bblscm_versiontag'.  The first of these
 components is included by every other component in 'bbl', and provides
 versioning information for the package group.  Users may use the
 'bblscm_version' facilities to query a particular 'bbl' library for its
 version information.  The second component defines macros that can be used for
 conditional-compilation based on 'bbl' version information.
