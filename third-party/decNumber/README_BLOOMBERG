This directory contains a copy of the DecNumber library version 3.68.

The upstream library can be obtained from
http://speleotrove.com/decimal/

The following changes have been made from the upstream:

- The "decnum.pdf", which contains the library documentation, has been removed.
  The library documentation can be found at the upstream web address.

- The mode of the source files have been changed to be no longer executable.

- Created 'wscript' file to build using waf, because the DecNumber library did
  not come with a build system.
