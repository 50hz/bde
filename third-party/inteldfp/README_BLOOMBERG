This directory contains a copy of the Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library
(inteldfp) version 2.0 Update 1.

The upstream library can be obtained from
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library

The following changes have been made from the upstream:

- The "EXAMPLES" and "TESTS" directories have been removed, mostly because they
  occupied about 20MB in size combined.

- The line breaks have been converted to use Unix Style from DOS style.

- The mode of the source files have been changed to be no longer executable.

- Created waf 'wscript' files to build using waf, because inteldfp has a
  makefile which is difficult to port to multiple platforms.
